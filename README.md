# Hi, I’m Rudransh

I’m a **Product Manager** focused on building **B2B products, workflows, and systems** that scale from zero to revenue.

My work sits at the intersection of **product strategy, GTM execution, and automation** — turning ambiguous problems into structured solutions that teams can **ship, sell, and operate**.

I’ve worked hands-on across **SaaS platforms, APIs, integrations, and automation engines**, with a strong bias toward outcomes: **adoption, revenue impact, and operational leverage**.

## What I Work On

### Product & GTM
- B2B SaaS products from early traction to multi-million ARR  
- GTM-driven product decisions: pricing, packaging, adoption loops  
- Building features that unlock **new revenue channels** (APIs, automation, integrations)

### Automation & Systems
- Workflow engines, event-based triggers, and rule systems  
- Internal and customer-facing automation to reduce manual ops  
- Designing scalable primitives: **macros, custom fields, workflows**

### Integrations & Platforms
- API-first product design  
- Deep integrations with CRM, ticketing, finance, and ops tools  
- Platform thinking: extensibility, configurability, partner ecosystems

### AI-First Product Thinking
- Applying AI pragmatically to workflows (not demos)  
- Agent-like systems for ops, support, and decision assistance  
- Evaluating AI for **ROI, reliability, and real user leverage**

### Builder Mindset
- No-code and low-code tools to prototype fast  
- Micro-SaaS ideas for the US B2B market  
- Clear PRDs, clean flows, and execution-ready specs
