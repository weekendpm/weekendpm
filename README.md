# Hi, I'm Rudransh

I'm a Product Manager building AI-native products, automation platforms, and marketplace systems that drive measurable business outcomes in B2B SaaS.

My work bridges **product strategy, technical execution, and go-to-market excellence**—taking complex problems from 0→1 and scaling them to enterprise adoption and revenue impact.

I've led products across support automation, two-sided marketplaces, and SaaS management platforms, with a focus on **what moves the needle**: conversion, adoption, operational efficiency, and ARR growth.

## What I Build

### AI & Automation Products
**Problem**: Fragmented knowledge, low retrieval accuracy, and rising support costs blocking self-serve scale  
**Approach**: LLM-powered knowledge intelligence, NLP search, and AI deflection systems  
**Impact**: 17% reduction in resolution time, 2× feature adoption across enterprise deployments

I build AI systems that solve real workflow problems—not demos. This includes:
- Conversation-to-content generation and retrieval workflows
- Knowledge gap detection and answer quality feedback loops
- Structured experimentation (A/B tests, pilot cohorts) to validate AI before scaling
- Analytics frameworks to measure accuracy, deflection, and business impact

### Marketplace & Platform Products
**Problem**: Low conversion funnels, fragmented supply, and slow partner onboarding  
**Approach**: Two-sided marketplace design, API integrations, and automated activation flows  
**Impact**: 4.6× conversion uplift (23% vs 5%), 180+ partners scaled in 12 months, 25% increase in direct bookings

I think in systems—balancing supply and demand, designing for liquidity, and building platforms that scale:
- Discovery, pricing visibility, and partner experience optimization
- Real-time inventory sync via APIs (15+ integrations)
- AI-driven lead enrichment cutting ops effort by 40%
- Growth experiments improving lead-to-booking conversion by 20%

### Workflow & Automation Engines
**Problem**: Manual IT operations and fragmented user lifecycle management  
**Approach**: Event-driven automation, SCIM/API provisioning, and role-based access systems  
**Impact**: 30% increase in workflow adoption, 70% of tasks automated, enterprise-scale operations

I build automation that compounds—not just scripts:
- Event-driven logic powering enterprise workflows at scale
- Multi-tenant systems for complex org structures
- Automation primitives (rules, triggers, actions) that users can configure
- Integration infrastructure enabling ecosystem expansion

## How I Work

### 0→1 Product Development
I thrive in ambiguity. I can take a rough idea, frame the problem, validate with customers, and ship an MVP that proves the concept. Then I iterate based on data.

### GTM-Driven Product Thinking
I don't just build features—I build features that **unlock revenue**. This means understanding:
- Pricing and packaging that drives adoption
- Activation loops that reduce time-to-value
- Channel strategies (direct, partner, API-led growth)
- Conversion optimization across the funnel

### Data-Driven Iteration
I instrument everything. I define success metrics upfront, build analytics infrastructure (SQL, product analytics tools), and use data to drive roadmap decisions and rollout strategies.

### Cross-Functional Leadership
I partner deeply with engineering, GTM, sales engineering, and operations. I synthesize feedback into clear PRDs, align on priorities, and drive execution without friction.

## Current Focus

I'm actively exploring:
- **AI agent systems** for support, ops, and decision automation
- **Micro-SaaS opportunities** in the US B2B market (API-first, workflow-native)
- **Platform extensibility patterns** that enable partner ecosystems and programmatic growth
- **No-code/low-code tooling** to prototype and validate ideas faster

I believe the best products are built at the intersection of **technical depth, business impact, and user-centric design**—backed by data, shipped iteratively, and scaled systematically.
